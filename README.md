# NexCall VAC - MEAN Stack Real-Time Communication Platform

> **Showcasing expertise in full-stack engineering, scalable architecture, and real-time systems with a robust MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) solution for modern communication needs.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**NexCall VAC** is a production-grade, real-time voice, audio, and chat communication platform built with the MEAN stack. It demonstrates end-to-end expertise in modern web development, scalable microservice design, and state-of-the-art real-time features using WebSockets and WebRTC.

- **Backend:** Node.js (Express), MongoDB (Mongoose), JWT authentication, Socket.io for real-time comms, and robust REST API structure.
- **Frontend:** Angular, RxJS, Angular Material, modular feature-first architecture, and responsive UI/UX.
- **DevOps:** Dockerized services, environment-based configs, API docs with Swagger/OpenAPI, and scalable deployment readiness.

## 🧑‍💻 Key Features & My Expertise

### 1. Real-Time Communication
- **1-to-1 and Group Calls:** Audio/video powered by WebRTC and Socket.io.
- **Instant Messaging (IM):** Private and group chat with dynamic presence and unread message tracking.
- **User Presence:** Live user/member lists, robust group management (create/join/leave).

### 2. Secure Auth & Authorization
- **JWT-based Auth:** Secure registration, login, and route protection with Express middleware.
- **Role-based Access:** Guards for authenticated user actions and granular API permissions.

### 3. Scalable & Maintainable Codebase
- **Feature Modules (Angular):** Auth, Call, Chat, Dashboard, and Settings—each isolated for testability and scaling.
- **Service Layer (Node.js):** Clear controller/service separation, RESTful APIs, socket event handlers, and validation.
- **Reusable Shared Components:** UI elements, pipes, directives for DRY and clean code.

### 4. DevOps and Documentation
- **Config-driven:** Environment configs, Docker for easy local and cloud deployment.
- **OpenAPI Docs:** Self-documented APIs for seamless integration/extension.
- **Logging & Error Handling:** Centralized error middleware and log utilities.
